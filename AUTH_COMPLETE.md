# 🔐 Authentication System - Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Authentication System**
- ✅ NextAuth.js v5 (App Router compatible)
- ✅ Credentials provider with email/password
- ✅ Two user roles: ADMIN and CUSTOMER
- ✅ Secure password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ JWT session strategy

### 2. **Database Models**
Updated Prisma schema with:
- ✅ UserRole enum (ADMIN, CUSTOMER)
- ✅ User model with role and customer relationship
- ✅ Customer-User relationship (one-to-one)

### 3. **Modern Login Page**
**URL**: `http://localhost:3002/auth/login`

**Features:**
- ✅ Clean, modern design with bee logo
- ✅ Email and password inputs
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Demo credentials displayed for testing
- ✅ Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism

### 4. **Middleware Protection**
Protected routes based on roles:

**Public Routes:**
- `/landing` - Landing page
- `/auth/login` - Login page

**Admin Routes** (require ADMIN role):
- `/` - Admin dashboard
- `/products` - Product management
- `/customers` - Customer management
- `/orders` - Order management
- `/cash-flow` - Cash flow tracking

**Customer Routes** (require CUSTOMER role):
- `/customer` - Customer dashboard
- `/customer/products` - Browse products
- `/customer/orders` - View own orders
- `/customer/profile` - Profile settings

### 5. **Customer Dashboard**
**URL**: `http://localhost:3002/customer` (after login as customer)

**Features:**
- ✅ Dedicated customer layout with bee logo
- ✅ Dashboard with order statistics:
  - Total orders
  - Pending orders
  - Total amount spent
- ✅ Recent orders table
- ✅ Color-coded order status badges
- ✅ User profile dropdown
- ✅ Logout functionality

### 6. **Admin Dashboard Updates**
- ✅ Added logout functionality
- ✅ Display user name and email from session
- ✅ User avatar with initials
- ✅ Bee logo in sidebar
- ✅ Session management

## 🔑 Demo Accounts

### Admin Account
```
Email: admin@shahd.com
Password: admin123
Role: ADMIN
Access: Full admin dashboard with all management features
```

### Customer Account
```
Email: customer@shahd.com
Password: customer123
Role: CUSTOMER
Access: Customer dashboard with order viewing
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. **User visits protected route** → Redirected to `/auth/login`
2. **User logs in** → Credentials validated against database
3. **Session created** → JWT token with user role stored
4. **Middleware checks role** → Routes user to appropriate dashboard
5. **User logged out** → Redirected to `/landing`

### Role-Based Redirection

**Admin Login:**
```
Login → Validate → Create Session (role: ADMIN) → Redirect to /
```

**Customer Login:**
```
Login → Validate → Create Session (role: CUSTOMER) → Redirect to /customer
```

### Middleware Logic

```typescript
// Middleware protects routes based on role
if (adminRoute && role !== "ADMIN") → Redirect to /customer
if (customerRoute && role !== "CUSTOMER") → Redirect to /
if (not authenticated) → Redirect to /auth/login
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Test Admin Access
```bash
# Visit: http://localhost:3002/landing
# Click "Sign In"
# Login with: admin@shahd.com / admin123
# Should redirect to: http://localhost:3002/ (admin dashboard)
# Try accessing: /products, /customers, /orders, /cash-flow ✅
# Try accessing: /customer ❌ (should redirect to /)
```

### 2. Test Customer Access
```bash
# Logout from admin
# Login with: customer@shahd.com / customer123
# Should redirect to: http://localhost:3002/customer
# See customer dashboard with orders
# Try accessing: /products ❌ (should redirect to /customer)
# Try accessing: / ❌ (should redirect to /customer)
```

### 3. Test Logout
```bash
# Click user avatar in top right
# Click "Log out"
# Should redirect to: http://localhost:3002/landing
```
